# High Brilliance Muon Beam Production and Tracking Simulation

## Introduction

This project aims to simulate the production and tracking of a high brilliance muon beam. The method involves shooting high-energy positrons at a target to produce muons, with a focus on minimizing beam divergence.

## Experimental Setup

### Components

- **Target**: Reaction site for positrons.
- **Dipole Magnet**: 1-meter long, 1 Tesla.
- **Tracking Detectors**: Silicon pixel detectors with resolutions between 50 to 200 micrometers.

### Layout Constraints

- Compact setup within 20 meters.
- Budget considerations limit the number of detectors and their resolution.

## Simulation Steps

1. Define detector sizes and placements.
2. Generate a synthetic dataset with smeared hits and noise.
3. Develop a tracking algorithm for particles.
4. Calculate muon momentum and angular resolution.

## Implementation Details

### Detector Sizes and Placement

- Detectors before the target and after the magnet should cover the entire beam cross-section.
- After-target detector should capture all emerging particles.

### Synthetic Dataset

- Simulate events and record hits.
- Apply smearing based on resolution and add Poisson noise.

### Tracking Algorithm

- Use Kalman filter for tracking.
- Implement clustering for shared hits.

### Resolution Calculation

- Compute momentum and angular divergence resolutions.

## Example Code

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define constants
detector_resolutions = [50e-6, 100e-6, 200e-6]  # in meters
magnetic_field = 1  # Tesla
detector_positions = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # in meters

# Function to generate synthetic data
def generate_event():
    # Generate random hits
    hits = [np.random.normal(0, res) for res in detector_resolutions]
    # Add noise
    hits = [hit + np.random.poisson(1) for hit in hits]
    return hits

# Function to track particles
def track_particles(hits):
    # Implement Kalman filter tracking
    pass

# Main simulation loop
events = []
for _ in range(1000):
    event = generate_event()
    track_particles(event)
    events.append(event)

# Compute resolutions
# (Add relevant calculations here)

# Plot results
plt.hist([event[0] for event in events], bins=50)
plt.xlabel('Hit Position (m)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Hits at First Detector')
plt.show()
